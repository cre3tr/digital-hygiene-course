# ☁️ Lesson 3: Cloud Storage Security

**Time Required:** 20 minutes

**Objective:** Secure cloud storage to prevent data leaks.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Cloud breaches can expose sensitive files. Proper settings prevent unauthorized access.

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Audit Shared Links

- **Google Drive:** [drive.google.com](http://drive.google.com) → Shared → Remove unnecessary access
- **Dropbox:** [dropbox.com](http://dropbox.com) → Sharing → Delete unused links
- **OneDrive:** [onedrive.live.com](http://onedrive.live.com) → Shared → Revoke expired shares

### Step 2: Secure Sharing Settings

- Set link expiration (30-90 days)
- Use password protection for sensitive shares
- Prefer "view only" permissions

### Step 3: Encrypt Sensitive Files

- Use tools like **VeraCrypt** or **ESET Secure Data** for encryption
- Organize files by sensitivity level in separate folders

### Step 4: Backup Strategy

- Follow 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite
- Enable versioning for key documents

## ✅ Completion Checklist

- Shared links audited
- Secure sharing settings applied
- Sensitive files encrypted
- Backup strategy implemented

**🔒 Security Tip:** Regularly review shared links to ensure only authorized users have access.
